      "description": "This is an artist's concept of an orbiting space vehicle in the Jovian system using an electrodynamic tether propellantless propulsion system. Electrodynamic tethers offer the potential to greatly extend and enhance future scientific missions to Jupiter and the Jovian system. Like Earth, Jupiter posses a strong magnetic field and a significant magnetosphere. This may make it feasible to operate electrodynamic tethers for propulsion and power generation.",
